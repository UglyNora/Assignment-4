   <p>MCL is a renowned artist who studied at what is formerly known as <br/> 
      The School Of Design at North Carolina State University.<br/>
      She works in both oils and acrylics on canvas. <br/>
      However, she prefers subtractive, stone sculpture, <br/>
       despite the difficulties of procurring weighty, geologic materials.
